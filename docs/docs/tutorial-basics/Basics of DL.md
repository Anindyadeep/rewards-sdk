### What is this Deep Learning

Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make decisions similar to humans. It's called "deep" learning because it involves training neural networks with multiple layers, which allows the computer to learn more complex patterns and relationships in data.

Think of it like this: you have a big stack of flashcards with pictures of animals on them. If you only had one layer to your brain, you would have to look at each individual card and memorize what animal it was. But because you have multiple layers in your brain, you can recognize patterns and features across multiple cards to quickly identify different animals.

Similarly, in deep learning, the computer looks at a lot of data and uses multiple layers of neural networks to recognize patterns and make predictions. This allows it to do things like classify images, generate text, and even play games.

Deep learning has many applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and entertainment. It's also used to power voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and self-driving cars. As computers continue to get faster and more powerful, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the field of deep learning.


### When Deep Learning meets Reinforcement Learning

Deep learning is a powerful tool in the field of reinforcement learning because it allows agents to learn from experience and make better decisions over time.

For example, imagine you're teaching a car to drive on a race track. You could program the car with specific rules for how to handle each turn and obstacle, but that would be very time-consuming and limiting. Instead, you can use deep reinforcement learning to let the car learn on its own.

You start by defining the car's "environment" - the race track - and the "reward" - the finish line. The car's goal is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. You then use deep neural networks to build an "agent" - the car's brain - that takes in information about the car's surroundings and outputs actions like "accelerate", "brake", and "turn left".

During training, the car drives around the track multiple times while the agent learns from its mistakes. The agent adjusts the car's actions based on the feedback it receives from the environment, which is represented by the reward. The more the car improves, the higher its reward, and the more likely it is to take the actions that lead to the finish line.

Over time, the agent becomes better and better at navigating the race track, and the car gets closer to achieving its goal. This is the power of deep reinforcement learning - it allows agents to learn from experience and improve their decision-making abilities in complex environments.

This approach has many practical applications, from self-driving cars to robotics and gaming. The possibilities are endless, and with advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the future.



### Get started with some basic terms



Neural network: A neural network is a machine learning model that's inspired by the structure of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes that perform simple computations on incoming data. Neural networks are commonly used in reinforcement learning to approximate the optimal policy that the agent should follow.

Input, output, and hidden layers: A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes. The input layer receives data from the environment, while the output layer produces actions to take. Hidden layers perform computations on the data in between the input and output layers.

Learning rate: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how quickly the agent adapts its policy based on new experiences. A high learning rate means the agent updates its policy more aggressively, while a low learning rate means it updates its policy more conservatively.

Loss function: A loss function is a function that measures how well the agent's predictions match the true values. It's used to train the neural network by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.

Optimizer: An optimizer is a method used to adjust the weights of the neural network to minimize the loss function. It's responsible for updating the parameters of the neural network during training.
