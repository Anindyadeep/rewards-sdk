# Introduction

Let's discover **Rewards AI in less than 5 minutes**.

Welcome to Rewards AI, the open-source organization focused on low-code and no-code reinforcement learning research, experimentation, and learning. Our mission is to democratize the field of RL by making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their programming skills.

Our platform offers two SDKs: a low-code SDK for Python, and a no-code web platform. With our SDKs, users can easily train their own agents in a predefined platform without writing much code. They simply choose the environment, configure the different parameters of the agent and hyperparameters, and build the neural network using drag-and-drop blocks. All they need to do is write a small reward function inside the web editor to create an experiment.

The agents are trained for a number of episodes, after which they are evaluated in a test platform and provided with a final reward score. If users are participating in a competition, they can use this score to take part in the leaderboard and compete with others.

Our platform is easy to use and accessible to anyone, whether they are beginners or experts in the field of RL. With our low-code and no-code solutions, users can focus on their research and experimentation without worrying about the technical details.
